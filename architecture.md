# Architecture
This section seeks explain some points about clean architecture.

### Principles
- SoC (separation of concerns)
- Use cases with first class citizens
- Dependency injection
- Testability

### Rules
- The modules more externals should depend of the more internals, but never the opposite.
- The limits between layers should be explicit.
- Frameworks are a detail.

### Diagram
Bellow you should see a summary of clean architecture.
