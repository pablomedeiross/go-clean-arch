## Summary
This image is a summary of concepts, relationships and responsibilities of the existenting layers.
With it image in mind let's talk about the following topics:

- [Principles](#Principles)
- [Concepts](#Concepts)
- [Layers](#Layers)
- [Relationships](#Relationships)
- [More about](#Moreabout)

<br/>

### Principles
Some of principles that guide this architecture are:
- SoC (separation of concerns)
- Use cases how first class citizens
- Dependency injection
- Testability

### Concepts
- The modules more externals should depend of the more internals, but never the opposite.
- The limits between layers should be explicit.
- Frameworks are a detail.
